                "correct": true,
                "feedback": "Yes. Adapter sequences should be absent, but, depending on the library preparation strategy, you may see these appear. Hint: They also might appear more often for CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag data."
            },
            {
                "answer": "Alignment of CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag may especially be impacted because they are more likely to have adapter sequences depending on the length of reads.",
                "correct": true,
                "feedback": "Because CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag represent a finer fragmentation, if you choose longer sequencing (100-150 bp), there is a higher chance that we may sequence into the adapter on the opposite end of the fragment. That's no big deal, but we should trim these off."
