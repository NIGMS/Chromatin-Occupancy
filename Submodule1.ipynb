As such, this module covers the processing of the data from three distinct but similar methods using downsampled data to improve runtime speed. The original data can be found in the GEO repository with the following accessions: ChIP-seq - GSE173550; CUT&RUN & CUT&Tag - GSE224292. These data were published in the following articles:\n",

    "### Single-end v.s. Paired-end Sequencing\n",
    "\n",
    "Illumina offers both single-end and paired-end sequencing. Single-end provides a short sequence from one end of the fragments. Paired-end provides a short sequence from both ends. While Single-end can be sufficient for many applications where we need a count of reads at specific positions, paired-end sequencing provides several advantages. One advantage is that paired-end reads provide more sequenced portions, useful for NGS applications that need to know the exact sequence; e.g. SNP detection and WGBS. Knowing the sequence of both ends can also help with the alignment of fragments when one end lies in a repetitive region (see the figure on the left). In this module, we'll demonstrate how to process single-end data for ChIP-seq and demonstrate processing paired-end data for CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag. However, we do recommend using paired-end sequencing for all of these methods if you are planning an experiment.\n",
